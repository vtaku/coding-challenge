# VTAKU Coding Challenge

Please setup a Ruby on Rails application, using heroku's free hobby instance and postgresql as the database.

The website should have two pages, one page where a user can submit an image and another page where it displays all the images submitted.

## Guidelines and tips
 - Use git and github for version control
 - Understand the fundamentals of MVC
 - Try to use the Rails mindset of convention over configuration, as this will make your life a lot easier
 - Refer to the documentation for rails and heroku; it literally shows you how to do things

Feel free to contact me if you have questions.

Do your best, even if you can't complete the whole task! We will reach out to schedule a debrief after the code challenge is over.

You have until noon on Sunday, July 25th to complete the code challenge.

## Submission guidelines
- Email the following to the organizer:
   - The github URL (please make it public or invite @VagishVela to it)
   - The heroku url to view the website
